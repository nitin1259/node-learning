August/September 2018 Update:

Google recently changed their policies surrounding the Geocoding API. Before you can use the API you need to create an account and set up billing information. While the API can still be used, this is not ideal.

If you're unable to get the Google API working, the guide below will show you how to get set up with the MapQuest Geocoding API. While this API also requires an API key, they have a generous free tier, and they don't require a credit card to get started. Thanks to Oliver for pointing out this alternative.

Using the MapQuest Geocoding API

1. Visit: https://developer.mapquest.com

2. Sign up for an account.

3. Once you're signed up, visit your profile page here: https://developer.mapquest.com/user/me/profile

4. Scroll down to "My Keys" and copy the long randomly generated key (screenshot).

5. Update the URL in your code to the following: http://www.mapquestapi.com/geocoding/v1/address?key=NI43FJwOfJfIE0ECvDcRMMJdAcGfs3RE&location=1301%20lombard%20street%20philadelphia. Make sure to replace "KEY" with the key you copied in step 4.

The response body is slightly different between the Google and MapQuestion APIs.

The latitude is stored on the response body here: body.results[0].locations[0].latLng.lat

The longitude is stored on the response body here: body.results[0].locations[0].latLng.lng

That will give you all the data needed to interact with the weather API. I plan on incorporating this into the course for future versions, but I'd like to have students test this approach out first.

Questions? Just leave a reply below.

Let me know if this works for you!

(old solution) Using the Google Geocoding API

If you're getting this error you'll need to do the following. I've updated this guide to reflect changes the Google website.

1. Head over to the Google Developer Console

2. Click "create" to create a new project (you'll need to create or sign in to a Google account).

3. On the "New Project" screen, click "create" to create the project with the default name.

4. Visit "library" in the sidebar. (screenshot)

5. Search for "Geocoding API" and select it.

6. On the Geocoding API page, click "enable" and wait for the API to be enable. This can fail. If it does, just click "enable" a second time.

7. This will bring you over to the library dashboard page. Select the credentials tab near the top of the page.

8. You should see two autogenerated keys listed. Copy the key value for the "Server key" to the clipboard.

9. Change the request URL by adding a "key" query string. That would be something like the following. Note I've added "&" to separate the key value pairs. The new key value pair is "key" for the key and the API Key from Google for the value.

https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1301+lombard+st+philadelphia&key=AIzaSyB5X-H6Ngctdv_N7thDVCgBru5i_yocb94
10. The request should work without any errors.
// key=AIzaSyB5X-H6Ngctdv_N7thDVCgBru5i_yocb94
